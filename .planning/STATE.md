# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Conditions stored in `strategy_conditions` join table with explicit `condition_type` column — no freeform encoding (avoids gear_notes dual-format pitfall)
- Init: Auth ships with Phase 5 admin builder, not as a separate prior phase — eliminates unauthenticated admin window
- Init: `strategyMatcher.ts` is a pure client-side utility, no UI or Supabase imports — fully unit-testable before any component depends on it
- Init: Phase 8 (UI Polish) depends on Phase 3 (Shared UI Components) not Phase 7 — can begin earlier if submission queue is deferred

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Init] Partial-match ranking threshold is a product decision (e.g., "show results matching at least 1 of N characters") — must be decided before Phase 4 planning
- [Init] Auth provider choice (email/password vs magic link) not yet decided — must be decided in Phase 5 planning
- [Init] Seed data strategy for offline fallback does not yet cover counter strategies — decide before Phase 4 CounterSearch page ships
